OpenUCX
=======
Unified Communication X (UCX) provides an optimized communication layer for
Message Passing (MPI), PGAS/OpenSHMEM libraries and RPC/data-centric
applications.

UCX utilizes high-speed networks for inter-node communication, and shared
memory mechanisms for efficient intra-node communication.
